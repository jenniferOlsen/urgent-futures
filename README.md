How to find your own future truth. A framework for understanding how you relate to different future challenges, and for exploring where you may have the most powerful opportunity to make change.

>The truest truth of the future is personal. It's whatever we feel deep in our bones that we really want to be different, whatever we really need to be different, whatever we are willing to howl twice a day about until it is different. It's whatever we are willing to spend not just a week, or a month, or a year, but a whole decade of our lives trying to make different.

Steps:

Pick any urgent challenge you feel strongly about and a specific community that you're a part of. Thinking of the challenge within the chosen community, answer these 4 questions on a scale of 1-10.

1. How urgent do you think it is to address this problem in this community?
2. How many people in this community do you think agree with you?
3. How optimistic are you that this problem will be significantly improved in your community in the next 10 years?
4. How much power do you personally have to influence how this problem is addressed in your community in the next 10 years?

Your final scores measure 4 different dimensions of how you relate to the future:
1. Your calling to the future
2. Your belonging to the future
3. Your hope for the future
4. Your power to shape the future

## Installing

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
